# MyProjects

This repo is a collection of projects I’ve made over the years.  
Most of these projects are what I remember clearly, or that I found on my computer. Some older or unfinished works are probably missing.

## nAnB (2021)

This project was made during my first year of senior high school.  
It started from a problem on an online judge website. I mainly wanted to practice basic logic, mostly for fun.

---

## 2048 (2022)

I built this project in my second year of high school as part of a self-directed learning program.

---

## game (2024)

This is essentially the same game idea as **nAnB**, but made again a few years later.
I’m not entirely sure why I ended up with two versions.

## tetris (2024)

This project was made during university. I didn’t have much going on and wanted something concrete to work on.

---

## game_test (2025)

This project was created by my university roommate and classmate, it's made by LLM.

## enigma (2025)

I worked on this project during the summer after my first year of university, when I had a lot of free time and no classes.

## MyFirstVueProject (2025)

This project was made in my second year of university while learning Vue.js.
